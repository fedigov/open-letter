**This is an open letter to the United States Congress to consider providing its message on the fediverse.**

The federal government of the United States has used the social media site X, formerly known as Twitter, for instantaneous communication with the general public. In October 2022, business magnate Elon Musk acquired Twitter. Since acquiring Twitter, Musk has contributed to an increase in hate speech and antisemitism, foreign disinformation and climate change denial, and cost-cutting measures that are detrimental to the platform.

The government should, then, consider alternative platforms to effectively communicate. Though Mastodon may not support all of the federal government's tools, such as live streaming, it is worth considering as X's rhetoric becomes more untenable. The [European Union](https://www.pcmag.com/news/eu-joins-mastodon-social-network-sets-up-its-own-server) and the [government of Switzerland](https://www.brusselstimes.com/689084/swiss-government-says-it-will-also-communicate-on-alternative-network-to-x) have considered using Mastodon as an alternative.

It is in the federal government's best interest to manage the platform it communicates with the public. After former president Donald Trump was suspended from Twitter in April 2021, Twitter [prevented](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/04/07/twitter-national-archives-realdonaldtrump-479743) the National Archives and Records Administration from making Trump's previous tweets publicly available. The federal government would be able to access and manage all account information if it established a Mastodon instance.

The federal government does not currently control how its content is displayed on X, nor is it accessible in a chronological view to users who are not logged in. X posts are limited to 280 characters. By contrast, Mastodon allows for 500 characters, and is in the process of allowing instance administrators to set their own limit.

A self-hosted Mastodon instance on White House servers would benefit from the security of the federal government. In July 2020, Barack Obama and Joe Biden's Twitter accounts were [hijacked](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/15/technology/twitter-hack-bill-gates-elon-musk.html) to promote a Bitcoin scam. Security policies implemented on White House servers would likely prevent the social engineering techniques performed to gain access to Obama and Biden's accounts.

It is unclear whether or not X is sustainable, particularly after an antisemitic comment by Musk that has been [denounced](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/17/us/politics/elon-musk-antisemitism-white-house.html) by the Biden administration. X was entirely supported by advertisements until the introduction of Twitter Blue in 2021, and advertisements continue to comprise an overwhelming majority of X revenue. Since Musk's comment was made, IBM, Disney, Apple, Amazon, Coca-Cola, Google, Microsoft, Netflix, and Walmart have stopped advertising on X.

Various reports have detailed harmful behavior occuring on X, including [amplifying content praising the October 7 attack on Israel](https://www.isdglobal.org/digital_dispatches/illegal-violent-terrorist-content-relating-to-hamas-israel-conflict-reaches-millions-on), [an increase in neo-Nazi content](https://networkcontagion.us/wp-content/uploads/CAM_Musk-Ye-Groypers_1.26.23_v2.pdf) and [antisemitism](https://www.springer.com/journal/42001), [growing anti-LGBT rhetoric](https://counterhate.com/research/toxic-twitter-anti-lgbtq/), and [thriving extremism](https://www.adl.org/resources/blog/extremists-and-conspiracy-theorists-reemerge-twitter). Climate-related misinformation [has thrived](https://healthfeedback.org/misinformation-superspreaders-thriving-on-musk-owned-twitter/) and accounts backed by [Russia](https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/c1d645d0-42f5-11ee-a8b8-01aa75ed71a1/language-de) and [the Islamic State](https://www.isdglobal.org/isd-in-the-news/isd-finds-an-increase-in-islamist-state-accounts-under-elon-musks-twitter-reign/) have increased in number.
